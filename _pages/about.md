Iâ€™m Marcus Rieker â€” a product leader and software engineer with a passion for building **AI-powered solutions** and **handcrafted web experiences**.  

Over the past 8+ years Iâ€™ve led projects ranging from **enterprise-scale AI chatbots** and **semantic search infrastructure** at AVB Marketing, to launching my own ventures like **Snowfall Designs** and **WyoGamez.com**. My work bridges **business strategy** with **technical execution**, whether thatâ€™s helping small businesses establish their digital presence or driving enterprise adoption of modern AI systems.  

When Iâ€™m not coding or tinkering with new ML models, youâ€™ll probably find me experimenting with retro-futuristic design (hence the Snowfall brand), 3D printing custom game accessories, or geeking out about board games and AI ethics.
